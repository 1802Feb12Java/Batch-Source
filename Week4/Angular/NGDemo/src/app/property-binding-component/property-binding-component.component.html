<p>
  Property binding is denoted by []
  <br> We specify one-way bindings to DOM properties using square brackets and template expressions.
  <br> Template expressions in quotes to the right of the equals are used to set DOM properties in square brackets on the left,
  i.e. [property] = "template expression"
</p>

<div [ngStyle]="styleObject" (click)="changeStyle()">
  Here is my property.
</div>

<p>
  Property binding can also be used to pass a propery to a child component:
  <!--
    <app-notes-component [notes]="notes"></app-notes-component>
  -->
</p>

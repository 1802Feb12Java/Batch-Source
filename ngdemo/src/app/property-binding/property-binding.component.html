<p>
  Property binding is denoted by [].
  We specify one-way bindings to DOM properties using square brackets and template expressions.

  Template expressions in quotes to the right of the equals are used to set DOM properties in square brackets on the left,
  i.e.: [property] = "template expression"
</p>
<div [ngStyle]="styleObj" (click)="changeStyle()">Here is my property</div>

<p>Property binding can also be used to pass a property to a child component:
  <!--
      <app-notes-component [notes]="notes"></app-notes-component>
  -->
</p>

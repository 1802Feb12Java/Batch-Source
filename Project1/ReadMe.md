# To run:

1. Open Project1.sql in Oracle Developer
2. Run the entire script (WARNING: CONTAINS SOMETHING THAT WILL DELETE ALL YOUR PREVIOUS TABLES/FUNCTIONS/SEQUENCES/STORED PROCEDURES)

3. Open Project1 in STS
4. Run on Tomcat Server

5. Open Project1Test in VS Code
6. Run "npm install" to get node_modules and all that joy
7. Run using "ng serve"

*Have both running before trying to do anything*


Some values I always default into the server:

* MANAGER: (id=1) (name=Jim George) (username=joe) (password=@@) (email=joe@email.com)
* EMPLOYEE: (id=2) (name=Joe Bob) (username=jim) (password=@!) (email=jim@email.com)

You should be able to see some reimbursement applications and stuff once you log into the manager.

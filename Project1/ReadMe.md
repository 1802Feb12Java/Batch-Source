To run:

Open Project1 in STS
Run on Tomcat Server

Open Project1Test in VS Code
(Probably have to run "npm install" to get node_modules and stuff)
Run using "ng serve"

Have both running before trying to do anything



Some values I always default into the server:

MANAGER: (id=1) (name=Jim George) (username=joe) (password=@@) (email=joe@email.com)
EMPLOYEE: (id=2) (name=Joe Bob) (username=jim) (password=@!) (email=jim@email.com)

You should be able to see some reimbursement applications and stuff once you log into the manager.
